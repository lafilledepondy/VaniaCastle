## Description

On the night of April 30th, a strange and eerie energy fills the air. It is **Unholy Walpurgis Night**—a night of whispering winds, flickering flames, and forgotten pacts come alive.. Shadows stretch long under the pale moonlight, as witches, lost souls, and ancient rites stir once more.

A young woman stands at the crossroads of fate, her heart burning with a singular purpose—vengeance. A curse wraps around her like a tight coil. She doesn’t have much time. To break free, she must face the one who cast it.

Her only guide is a map, handed down by a nameless oracle.
The journey ahead is treacherous—through forgotten ruins, cursed forests, and intricate labyrinths. Her journey will lead her to the stronghold of her enemy.

But the gate to that fortress is sealed by magic older than the stars. To enter, she must first find the _Four Elemental Keys_, each hidden in a place where time feels distorted: 

- **Sky Blue Key** — hidden where the winds sing secrets.
- **Violet Key** — lost between dreams and nightmares.
- **Crimson Key** — burning with the rage.
- **Golden Key** — buried beneath the endlessness of time.

Her purpose burns bright in the endless dark. Her quest is more than a search for revenge; it’s a desperate fight for freedom.

Tonight, the hunt begins. By dawn, the curse will be lifted.. or she will be nothing but another name lost to the night.

## Usage

## User interface

## Work organization

To conduct this project, we used various methods of collaboration. “Pair programming” was our main approach, where each member contributed to writing the code. We systematically reviewed each other’s code to debug or improve it. We used G-meet sessions and also practiced “virtual” side-by-side programming.

Regarding source code management with Git, we worked on separate branches to avoid version conflicts.
